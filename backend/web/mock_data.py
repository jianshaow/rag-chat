Not less than 5 inches long, 3-1/2 inches high, and 0.007-inch thick. For \npieces more than 6 inches long or 4-1/4 inches high, the minimum thickness \nis 0.009. (Pieces not meeting the 0.009 thickness are subject to a \nnonmachinable surcharge under 1.2f.) \nb. Not more than 11-1/2 inches long, or more than 6-1/8 inches high, or more \nthan 1/4-inch thick.\nc. Not more than 3.5 ounces. (Charge flat-size prices for First-Class Mail \nletter-size pieces over 3.5 ounces.)\nd. Rectangular, with four square corners and parallel opposite sides. \nLetter-size, card-type mailpieces made of cardstock may have finished corners that do not exceed a radius of 0.125 inch (1/8 inch). See \nExhibit 201.1.1.1 .\n1.2 Nonmachinable Criteria\nA letter-size piece is nonmachinable if it has one or more of the following characteristics (see 601.1.1.2  to determine the length, height, top, and bottom of \na mailpiece):\na. Has an aspect ratio (length divided by height) of less than 1.3 or more than 2.5.\nb. Is polybagged, polywrapped, enclosed in any plastic material, or has an \nexterior surface made of a material that is not paper. Windows in envelopes \nmade of paper do not make mailpieces nonmachinable. Attachments \nallowable under applicable eligibilit y standards do not make mailpieces \nnonmachinable. \nc. Has clasps, strings, buttons, or similar closure devices.Overview\n1.0 Physical Standards for Letters\n2.0 Physical Standards for Flats3.0 Physical Standards for Parcels4.0 Additional Physical Standards for Priority Mail Express5.0 Additional Physical Standards for Priority Mail6.0 Additional Physical Standards for First-Class Mail and USPS Ground \nAdvantage \u2014 Retail\n7.0 Additional Physical Standards for Media Mail and Library Mail",

When \ndetermining variance in thickness, exclude the outside edges of a mailpiece \n(1 inch from each edge) when the contents do not extend into those edges. Also, exclude the selvage of any polywrap covering (see 201.5.3 ) from this \ndetermination. Mailers must secure nonpaper contents to prevent shifting of \nmore than 2 inches within the mailpiece if shifting would cause the piece to be nonuniform in thickness or would result in the contents bursting out of the \nmailpiece (see 601.3.3 ).\n2.5 Ineligible Flat-Size Pieces \nFlat-size mailpieces that do not meet the eligibility standards in 2.3 and 2.4 are \nconsidered parcels, and customers mailin g these pieces must pay the applicable \nparcel prices.\n3.0 Physical Standards for Parcels\n3.1 Processing Categories \nUSPS categorizes parcels into one of three mail processing categories: \nmachinable, irregular, or nonmachinable parcel. These categories are based on the physical dimensions of the piece, regardless of the placement (orientation) of \nthe delivery address on the piece. For additional information on machinable, \nirregular, and nonmachinable processing categories, see 201.7.0 .\n3.2 Maximum Weight and Size\n[7-9-23]  All parcels must be large enough to hold the required delivery address, \nreturn address, mailing labels, postage, barcode, endorsement s, and other mail \nmarkings on the address side of the parcel. For mailability, all pieces 1/4 inch thick or less must be a minimum of 5 inches in length, 3-1/2 inches in height, and \n0.007 inch in thickness. No mailpiece may weigh more than 70 pounds. Except \nfor USPS Ground Advantage \u2013 Retail, which may not measure more than 130 inches in length and girth combined, no mailpiece may measure more than \n108 inches in length and girth combined. For parcels, length is the distance of \nthe longest dimension and girth is the distance around the thickest part. Lower size or weight standards apply to mail addressed to some APOs and FPOs \nsubject to 703.2.0  and 703.4.0  and for Department of State mail, subject to \n703.3.0 . \n3.3 Two or More Packages\nWith the exception of USPS-produced Flat Rate Envelopes and Boxes, two or \nmore packages may be mailed as a single parcel, if they are about the same size \nor shape, if they are securely wrapped or fastened together, and if they do not together exceed the weight or size limits.",
